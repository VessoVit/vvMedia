# Creative Technology Toolbox
is a set of resources, learning materials and techniques focused on the technical aspect of the arts. The toolbox is mainly practical tools and surrounding it skills.

## openFrameworks and Processing
The two platform vagluely represent programming and coding, the hardcore and beginer level when it comes to programming and graphics. Poetry with code is just another way for mdoern artists to express idea and concept, but in the domain of code. 

objets -> compositions -> motion -> adaptability -> life 

Processing is represting the notebook of the artists, where all kind of thouts and experiments can be quickly saved by the artist. 

Variables, Functions, Classes, Arrays 

Data Structures and Algorithms

Complexity and Life cycle

### Procedural Generated Code
It is in the ability of creator with understading of creative technology tools, to procedury generate forms, materials, cities and even space galacties. 

### Advance Graphics
