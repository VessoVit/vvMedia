# .What is Creative Technology

We all live in digital era and first generation of digital native are stepping into adult and business world. Without doubt technologies will involved more and more in our everyday life in one form or another. My goal is to be part of the construction of this new world, where technology makes our life easier and help us to achieve greater good. (e.g. developing more officiant green energy, our putting into flame the global consumption of resources or simply reading and understanding human mind)

Taking part in developing technology for the future is challenge, which involves a lot of creativity, out of a box thinking and ingenuity. Its really hard to imagine in what direction technology will lead us, but no matter the changes I would always be involved in the process of developing the new age. I good example of confusion is coming from Bill Gates, how is said to be the pope of the Personal Computers. He said back in 1981: 640K ought to be enough for anybody. It seams to be hard even for the pioneer to imagine what will be the market demand in 5-6 years. One think is for sure, technology are developing with great speed and significantly shaping the world. Now people are adapting new technologies easier and faster. The global collaborative network is almost covering the whole human world. Soon Africa and Asia will became major markets and then truly the world well be globalized. 

In this world, we need to think for the better use of technology. Finally when we have major part of global population wired or connected to the Web, we can sit together and solve global problems, considering everybody’s opinion. That's possible, because the initial idea of computers are to solve problems. We developed languages and collaborate for open source OS, which run thousands of servers worldwide, just to receive the answers of our question back.

The important aspect of my program is not only the technology, but creativity. The already known tool provide us to easy access to all known approaches and ways of communication. You can learn any computer language in not time, you need just to have the will and by the use of WorldWideWeb. A good way to start my statement for creativity is to illustrate with quote:

**"Every child is born an artist, the problem is to remain one once they grow up."**  - _Pablo Picasso_

I have been think about this quote for quite some time. It provoke a flow of toughs in my mind and more important a question raised. Why creativity is so noticeable in children and disappear with adults. Well I think the key elements and differences are three: children are willing to exploring the world everyday, they are not afraid of making mistakes and sometimes has crazy ideas.

Creativity is process which involved not only our thinking, but also our feelings and experience. Being creative is about being a bit crazy and some times unreasonable, but that's the way it supposed to be. If we can break the box, start doing crazy stuff, which world never imagine before and combine our creativity in single idea or product, then innovation could be born. Creativity is about turning up with new thinks, but innovation is the process of making them real, to complete an idea. With the tools of Technology and Creativity we can be driven to new innovation and representative better world. 

Innovation is what drives my life. I live for the progress and like a quote stated “curiosity is the key for boredom”. So why I want to study creative technology ? Well, because have endless curiosity to explore and world, I’m bit crazy and inordinate and I see technology helping us making the world better place. What else missing? Ah yes, creativity - am I creative? That’s something, which I will left to discover on your own. You can check my portfolio (http://vv-studio.com) or experience a group project, but for sure you can discover on your own.
